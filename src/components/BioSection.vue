		You must be incredibly bored to have ended up in this corner of the internet. Anyway, while you're here: I'm Toby (if you didn't read my little mihi up there) and I'm currently interested in computer science, software engineering/design, photography, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)">ultimate frisbee</a> (among a dozen other things). If you want to kill some time, some of my most worth-while time sinks have been learning <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>, <a href="https://neovim.io/">(Neo)</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>. Have fun :)
